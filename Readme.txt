I wrote a program to simulate a game where the goal is to get as many successes as possible on three different lines.
The probability of success increases or decreases based on the number of successes or failures on each line.
The program runs the game 100,000 times, keeping track of the number of successes and failures on each line,
and calculates the overall expected value and range of the differences between the successes on lines 1 and 2 and the successes on line 3.
It also calculates the overall expected absolute value and range of the total successes on lines 1 and 2.
The program repeats this process for different probability limits and prints the results.
